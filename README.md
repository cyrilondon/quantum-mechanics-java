# quantum-mechanics-java
This project provides a java implementation of some well-known quantum algorithms as introduced in the `Quantum mechanics` section of our web site [einsteinrelativelyeasy.com](https://einsteinrelativelyeasy.com/index.php/quantum-mechanics)

As for now, it provides the implementations of:
- Entangled Bell State
- Teleportation algorithm

It uses the quantum java API Strange, available [here](https://github.com/gluonhq/strange)
